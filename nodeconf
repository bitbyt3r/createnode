# Objects in brackets are replaced by the corresponding value.
# The parser is simple and stupid, be gentle.
# The variables in brackets do _not_ have to be defined before
# reference, so you may use node information in the main section.
#i.e. private_dir = /openvz/<name> will change based on the node
# using it.
# Note, however, that if a variable is resolved locally, it will
# not be replaced again later. If you set the name in the main,
# it will be applied everywhere.
